label line is below text box shadow


EDIT:
delete a whole route line


add label colour callback for areas

fix scale factor when editing and viewing

mak sure using minned version in prod






how to sort lines:

first compare by left to right x pos - easy

- if they are the same then compare by the angle to the first bolt
- they are still the same then get the angle you just had and work out the angle of 'bend' to the next point and compare tha
- keep doing that again!



mak hidden truly hidden on select as well

convert line to two lines with arrow heads, make the shadow behind the box and the line above

make anchors snappable to each other as well as other points



reset position - back to centroid

position label
 - when adding points after the third point, if no label then auto create
 - drag about

make label text input live update the label
 - refactor updatelabel into seperate method
