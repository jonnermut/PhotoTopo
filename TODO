onchange text label update

if second point is moved then restyle first label

if econd pointis removed hen restyle first label

if data is missing get -1 1 llabel instead


if point it -1 -1 then don't show

if first vertex is added and no label x/y then add it





EDIT:
label
label select
label offset
delete a whole route line


hover select


add label colour callback for areas

fix scale factor when editing and viewing

add default label from area node name

mak sure using minned version in prod

add ghost vertex path for easyier splitting





how to sort lines:

first compare by left to right x pos - easy

- if they are the same then compare by the angle to the first bolt
- they are still the same then get the angle you just had and work out the angle of 'bend' to the next point and compare tha
- keep doing that again!



mak hidden truly hidden on select as well

convert line to two lines with arrow heads, make the shadow behind the box and the line above

make anchors snappable to each other as well as other points



reset position - back to centroid

position label
 - when adding points after the third point, if no label then auto create
 - drag about

make label text input live update the label
 - refactor updatelabel into seperate method

DONE

inconsistent handle sizes for new points vs existing area points
add arrow head line style
option to stretch width to docked side
make label draggable
make label
add a label shadow layer
consolidate all stacking layers into simple common code
fix border colour clash when label over border

left|middle|right
top|center|bottom
hide|show|pointer
width:same|flexi
render label
hover/click on label
hover/click on line
move all selection deselection drawing code to redraw 
get snapping working
get split vertex working
get add vertix working
 - if a selected vertex, add a new vertex after it
get hover events working
 - dummy that select the node
click on poly on fire click handler / select
get edit working
get render working
